CHOMP is a cosmology and halo model theoretical prediction code written in Python designed to take full advantage of the object oriented nature of the language. The object orientation allows for easy modification within the code base and by users as theoretical models mature and change.

Formerly part of the astro-stomp code base (http://code.google.com/p/astro-stomp/).
